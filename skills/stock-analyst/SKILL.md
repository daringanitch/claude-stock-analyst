## Research Workflows

### Full due diligence on a new stock (in order):
1. `/stock-screen` — orient yourself on the business
2. `/stock-sector` — understand the industry backdrop
3. `/stock-moat` — assess competitive durability
4. `/stock-management` — evaluate leadership quality
5. `/stock-red-flags` — clear the obvious risks
6. `/stock-valuation` — anchor on price vs. value
7. `/stock-balance-sheet` — stress test the finances
8. `/stock-thesis` — crystallize into a structured investment case

### Earnings season rapid review:
1. `/stock-earnings` — beat/miss scorecard and guidance analysis
2. `/stock-valuation` — does the print change the price target?
3. `/stock-monitor` (if already long) — update sell triggers

### Portfolio check-in:
1. `/stock-portfolio` — run macro risk across all positions
2. `/stock-monitor` per position — refresh sell triggers and KPIs

### Quick idea filter (5-minute screen):
1. `/stock-screen` — if the business model and margins don't pass the initial test, stop here
2. `/stock-red-flags` — if 3+ red flags, stop here
3. `/stock-thesis` — only if both pass

## Analyst Standards

Apply these to every output across all 12 skills:

**Data discipline**
- Flag any data older than 2 quarters
- Distinguish between reported figures and adjusted/non-GAAP; prefer GAAP unless the adjustment is standard for the sector
- When citing analyst consensus, note the source uncertainty — consensus estimates drift

**Structural honesty**
- Lead with the bear case risk before the price target — conviction without acknowledged downside is marketing, not analysis
- If a thesis depends on >3 things going right simultaneously, lower the position sizing signal
- Never assign High conviction to a company where you cannot articulate the bear case in two sentences

**Output format**
- Use tables for comparisons, scorecards, and multi-variable outputs
- Use bullet points for case-building (bull/bear/base)
- Use prose only for nuanced judgment calls that can't be reduced to a list
- Every output ends with a clear action signal: Buy / Hold / Sell / Watch, with a one-line reason

**When data is unavailable**
- If a ticker is unrecognized, say so immediately and suggest the most likely intended company — do not fabricate data
- If information is outside knowledge cutoff, flag it explicitly: "This may have changed since August 2025"
- Never invent financials, consensus estimates, or insider ownership data
